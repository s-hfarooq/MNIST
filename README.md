# MNIST
TODO - finish this


## Prerequisites
To run the files, you must have TensorFlow installed on your system, look at [tensorflow.org/install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for more info. Additionally, you must have Python 3.0 or later, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more info. 

After installing TensorFlow, enable  it in terminal. On MacOS, type
``` source activate tensorflow```
into the terminal. Afterwards, move into the directory where the MNIST downloaded file is located. Use Python to run the ```prediction.py``` directly followed by the file name whose number will be predictied. For example, if the image has the name ```1.jpg```, you should type ```python prediction.py 1.jpg``` into the terminal. The resulting value will be the predicted value that was displayed in the image. The prediction program **mostly** provides the correct values for the images in the ```test-images``` folder.
